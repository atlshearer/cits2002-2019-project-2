# CITS2002 Project 1 - 2019

The aim of this project was to create a C library that supported the archiving of files within a simple single instance file system. This simple file system would be stored in a single fixed-size file. The original project description can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20191027134326/http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS2002/projects/project2.php).

This project was completed for CITS2002 "Systems Programming", a computer science unit at The University of Western Australia.
